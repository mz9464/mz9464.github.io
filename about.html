						<h2>The formalities</h2>
						<p>
							I am a third year student at Rochester Institute of Technology. Iâ€™m on track to 
							graduate with an interdisciplinary degree in computing and art. I plan on getting a career in 
							computer science while producing professional illustrations on the side. 
							My dream is to become an board game illustrator that will bring people together.

						<h2>The informalities</h2>
						<p>
							I read a lot of webtoons (similar to web comics), talk with friends,
							and game. When I am not coding or drawing, most of my freetime is spent on 
							Steam and Discord. I am a huge fan of board games, trading card games, 
							and video games. My only skill in life is being good at Tetris and I also 
							really love pigeons.
