				<h2>Applied Arts and Sciences</h2>
				<p>
				When I started college, I thought I would graduate with a regular 
				degree in Computer Science. But as the college experience went on, 
				I realized that life wasn’t a linear path, and there was more to 
				offer than just focusing on one specific field. Now, I’m on 
				track to graduate with an interdisciplinary degree in computing 
				and art. I plan on getting a career in computer science while 
				producing professional illustrations on the side. My dream is 
				to become an board game illustrator that will bring people together.
